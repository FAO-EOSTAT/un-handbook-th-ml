    "The following examples show how to train machine learning methods and apply them to classify a single time series. We use the set `samples_matogrosso_mod13q1`, containing time series samples from the Brazilian Mato Grosso state obtained from the MODIS MOD13Q1 product. It has 1,892 samples and nine classes (`Cerrado`, `Forest`, `Pasture`, `Soy_Corn`, `Soy_Cotton`, `Soy_Fallow`, `Soy_Millet`). Each time series covers 12 months (23 data points) with six bands (NDVI, EVI, BLUE, RED, NIR, MIR). The samples are arranged along an agricultural year, starting in September and ending in August. The dataset was used in the paper \"Big Earth observation time series analysis for monitoring Brazilian agriculture\" [[16](#ref-picoli2018)], and is available in the R package `sitsdata`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `sits_train()` function provides a standard interface to all machine learning models. This function takes two mandatory parameters: the training data (`samples`) and the ML algorithm (`ml_method`). After the model is estimated, it can classify individual time series or data cubes with `sits_classify()`. In what follows, we show how to apply each method to classify a single time series. Then, in Chapter [Image classification in data cubes](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/cl_rasterclassification.html), we discuss how to classify data cubes.\n",

    "Since `sits` is aimed at remote sensing users who are not machine learning experts, it provides a set of default values for all classification models. These settings have been chosen based on testing by the authors. Nevertheless, users can control all parameters for each model. Novice users can rely on the default values, while experienced ones can fine-tune model parameters to meet their needs. Model tuning is discussed at the end of this Chapter. \n",

    "When a set of time series organized as tibble is taken as input to the classifier, the result is the same tibble with one additional column (`predicted`), which contains the information on the labels assigned for each interval.

    "Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble learning method for classification tasks. The algorithm consists of multiple decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the training data and with a different subset of features. To make a prediction, each decision tree in the forest independently classifies the input data. The final prediction is made based on the majority vote of all the decision trees. The randomness in the algorithm comes from the random subsets of data and features used to train each decision tree, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model. This classifier measures the importance of each feature in the classification task, which can be helpful in feature selection and data visualization. For an in-depth discussion of the robustness of Random Forest for satellite image time series classification, please see Pelletier et al [[14](#ref-pelletier2016)]. "

XGBoost builds trees one at a time, where each new tree helps to correct errors made by previously trained tree. Each tree builds a new model to correct the errors made by previous models. Using gradient descent, the algorithm iteratively adjusts the predictions of each tree by focusing on instances where previous trees made errors. Models are added sequentially until no further improvements can be made. \n",

XGBoost is often preferred for its speed and performance, particularly on large datasets and is well-suited for problems where precision is paramount. Random Forest, on the other hand, is simpler to implement, more interpretable, and can be more robust to overfitting, making it a good choice for general-purpose applications."

    "The boosting method starts from a weak predictor and then improves performance sequentially by fitting a better model at each iteration. It fits a simple classifier to the training data and uses the residuals of the fit to build a predictor. Typically, the base classifier is a regression tree. Although random forest and boosting use trees for classification, there are significant differences. The performance of Random Forest generally increases with the number of trees until it becomes stable. Boosting trees apply finer divisions over previous results to improve performance [[9](#ref-hastie2009)].

The `max_depth` value controls the maximum depth of the trees. Increasing this value will make the model more complex and likely to overfit (default is 6). The `subsample` parameter controls the percentage of samples supplied to a tree. Its default is 1 (maximum). Setting it to lower values means that xgboost randomly collects only part of the data instances to grow trees, thus preventing overfitting. The `nrounds` parameter controls the maximum number of boosting interactions; its default is 100, which has proven to be enough in most cases. To follow the convergence of the algorithm, users can turn the `verbose` parameter on. In general, the results using the extreme gradient boosting algorithm are similar to the Random Forest method.\n"

    "## Deep Learning using Multilayer Perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "To support deep learning methods, `sits` uses the `torch` R package, which takes the Facebook `torch` C++ library as a back-end. Machine learning algorithms that use the R `torch` package are similar to those developed using `PyTorch`. The simplest deep learning method is multilayer perceptron (MLP), which are feedforward artificial neural networks. An MLP consists of three kinds of nodes: an input layer, a set of hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer has the same dimension as the number of features in the dataset. The hidden layers attempt to approximate the best classification function. The output layer decides which class should be assigned to the input. In an MLP, all inputs are treated equally at first; based on iterative matching of training and test data, the backpropagation technique feeds information back to the initial layers to identify the most suitable combination of inputs that produces the best output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `sits`, MLP models can be built using `sits_mlp()`. Since there is no established model for generic classification of satellite image time series, designing MLP models requires parameter customization. The most important decisions are the number of layers in the model and the number of neurons per layer. These values are set by the `layers` parameter, which is a list of integer values. The size of the list is the number of layers, and each element indicates the number of nodes per layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the number of layers depends on the inherent separability of the dataset to be classified. For datasets where the classes have different signatures, a shallow model (with three layers) may provide appropriate responses. More complex situations require models of deeper hierarchy. Models with many hidden layers may take a long time to train and may not converge. We suggest to start with three layers and test different options for the number of neurons per layer before increasing the number of layers. In our experience, using three to five layers is a reasonable compromise if the training data has a good quality. Further increase in the number of layers will not improve the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "MLP models also need to include the activation function. The activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. Following standard practices [[8](#ref-goodfellow2016)], we use the `relu` activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization method (`optimizer`) represents the gradient descent algorithm to be used. These methods aim to maximize an objective function by updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function [[17](#ref-ruder2016)]. Since gradient descent plays a key role in deep learning model fitting, developing optimizers is an important topic of research [[1](#ref-bottou2018)]. Many optimizers have been proposed in the literature, and recent results are reviewed by Schmidt et al. [[20](#ref-schmidt2021)]. The Adamw optimizer  provides a good baseline and reliable performance for general deep learning applications [[13](#ref-kingma2017)]. By default, all deep learning algorithms in `sits` use Adamw. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another relevant parameter is the list of dropout rates (`dropout`). Dropout is a technique for randomly dropping units from the neural network during training [[22](#ref-srivastava2014)]. By randomly discarding some neurons, dropout reduces overfitting. Since a cascade of neural nets aims to improve learning as more data is acquired, discarding some neurons may seem like a waste of resources. In practice, dropout prevents an early convergence to a local minimum [[8](#ref-goodfellow2016)]. We suggest users experiment with different dropout rates, starting from small values (10-30%) and increasing as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows how to use `sits_mlp()`. The default parameters have been chosen based on a modified version of [24](#ref-wang2017), which proposes using multilayer perceptron as a baseline for time series classification. These parameters are: (a) Three layers with 512 neurons each, specified by the parameter `layers`; (b) Using the \"relu\" activation function; (c) dropout rates of 40%, 30%, and 20% for the layers; (d) the \"optimizer_adamw\" as optimizer (default value); (e) a number of training steps (`epochs`) of 100; (f) a `batch_size` of 64, which indicates how many time series are used for input at a given step; and (g) a validation percentage of 20%, which means 20% of the samples will be randomly set aside for validation.\n",

In the TempCNN reference paper [[15](#ref-pelletier2019)], the authors favourably compare their model with the Recurrent Neural Network proposed by Russwurm and Körner [[18](#ref-russwurm2018)]. [Figure 8](#fig-ml-tcnn) shows the architecture of the TempCNN model. TempCNN applies one-dimensional convolutions on the input sequence to capture temporal dependencies, allowing the network to learn long-term dependencies in the input sequence.

Due to its multi-scale approach, TempCNN can capture complex temporal patterns in the data and produce accurate predictions."

    "The result has important differences from the previous ones. The TempCNN model indicates the `Soy_Cotton` class as the most likely one in 2004. While this result is possibly wrong, it shows that the time series for 2004 is different from those of Forest and Pasture classes. One possible explanation is that there was forest degradation in 2004, leading to a signature that is a mix of forest and bare soil. In this case, including forest degradation samples could improve the training data. In our experience, TempCNN models are a reliable way of classifying image time series [[21](#ref-simoes2021)]. Recent work which compares different models also provides evidence that TempCNN models have satisfactory behavior, especially in the case of crop classes [[19](#ref-russwurm2020)].\n",

    "## Residual 1D CNN networks (ResNet)\n",
    "\n",
    "A residual 1D CNN network, also known as ResNet, is an extension of the standard 1D CNN architecture,  adding residual connections between the layers. Residual connections allow the network to learn residual mappings, which are the difference between the input and output of a layer. By adding these residual connections, the network can learn to bypass specific layers and still capture essential features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Residual Network (ResNet) for time series classification was proposed by Wang et al. [[24](#ref-wang2017)], based on the idea of deep residual networks for 2D image recognition [[10](#ref-he2016)]. The ResNet architecture comprises 11 layers, with three blocks of three 1D CNN layers each (see [Figure 11](#fig-ml-rnet)). Each block corresponds to a 1D CNN architecture. The output of each block is combined with a shortcut that links its output to its input, called a skip connection. The purpose of combining the input layer of each block with its output layer (after the convolutions) is to avoid the so-called \"vanishing gradient problem\". This issue occurs in deep networks as the neural network's weights are updated based on the partial derivative of the error function. If the gradient is too small, the weights will not be updated, stopping the training [[11](#ref-hochreiter1998)]. Skip connections aim to avoid vanishing gradients from occurring, allowing deep networks to be trained."

It is useful to experiment a bit with these kernel sizes in the case of satellite image time series.

In the same way as TempCNN, the ResNet algorithm tends to be better at detecting agricultural or natural forest classes.

    "## Attention-based models\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention-based deep learning models are a class of models that use a mechanism inspired by human attention to focus on specific parts of input during processing. These models have been shown to be effective for various tasks such as machine translation, image captioning, and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind attention-based models is to allow the model to selectively focus on different input parts at different times. This is done by introducing a mechanism that assigns weights to each element of the input, indicating the relative importance of that element to the current processing step. The model uses them to compute a weighted sum of the input. The results capture the model's attention on specific parts of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention-based models have become one of the most used deep learning architectures for problems that involve sequential data inputs, e.g., text recognition and automatic translation. The general idea is that not all inputs are alike in applications such as language translation. Consider the English sentence \"Look at all the lonely people\". A sound translation system needs to relate the words \"look\" and \"people\" as the key parts of this sentence to ensure such link is captured in the translation. A specific type of attention models, called transformers, enables the recognition of such complex relationships between input and output sequences [[23](#ref-vaswani2017)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic structure of transformers is the same as other neural network algorithms. They have an encoder that transforms textual input values into numerical vectors and a decoder that processes these vectors to provide suitable answers. The difference is how the values are handled internally. The two main differences between transformer models and other algorithms are positional encoding and self-attention. Positional encoding assigns an index to each input value, ensuring that the relative locations of the inputs are maintained throughout the learning and processing phases. Self-attention compares every word in a sentence to every other word in the same sentence, including itself. In this way, it learns contextual information about the relation between the words. This conception has been validated in large language models such as BERT [[4](#ref-devlin2019)] and GPT-4 [[2](#ref-bubeck2023)].\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of attention-based models for satellite image time series analysis is proposed by Garnot et al. [[7](#ref-garnot2020a)] and Russwurm and Körner [[19](#ref-russwurm2020)]. A self-attention network can learn to focus on specific time steps and image features most relevant for distinguishing between different classes. The algorithm tries to identify which combination of individual temporal observations is most relevant to identify each class. For example, crop identification will use observations that capture the onset of the growing season, the date of maximum growth, and the end of the growing season. In the case of deforestation, the algorithm tries to identify the dates when the forest is being cut. Attention-based models are a means to identify events that characterize each land class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first model proposed by Garnot et al. is a full transformer-based model [[7](#ref-garnot2020a)]. Considering that image time series classification is easier than natural language processing, Garnot et al. also propose a simplified version of the full transformer model [[6](#ref-garnot2020)]. This simpler model uses a reduced way to compute the attention matrix, reducing time for training and classification without loss of quality of the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `sits`, the full transformer-based model proposed by Garnot et al. [[7](#ref-garnot2020a)]   is implemented using `sits_tae()`. The default parameters are those proposed by the authors. The default optimizer is `optim_adamw`, as also used in the `sits_tempcnn()` function."

It points out the possible need for more classes and training data to better represent the transition period between 2004 and 2010. One possibility is that the training data associated with the Pasture class is only consistent with the time series between the years 2005 to 2008. However, the transition from Forest to Pasture in 2004 and from Pasture to Agriculture in 2009-2010 is subject to uncertainty since the classifiers do not agree on the resulting classes.
